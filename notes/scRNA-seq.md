## Single Cell RNA sequencing
- Measures 'distribution of expression levels' for each gene across a population of cells.
- **Workflow.** Solid tissue -> Dissociation -> Isolate -> RNA -> cDNA -> amplify -> Sequence -> get expression profiles -> ID Cell types
- **Expression matrix.** Each **row represents a gene**. Each **col** represents a cell.
